## My process used for creation

###  The page was  Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bai+Jamjuree) - For font styles
- [Icons images](https://fontawesome.com)- For icon images
- [Color properties](https://convertingcolors.com/hsl-color-171_50_44.html)-For color


### What I learned

In this Project I have been able to learn how to use the css style **position** to enable the pages to overlapp each other

To see how you can add code position, see below:

```html
    <div id="page1-display">
        <......>
    </div>
```
```css
#page1-display{
        position: absolute;
        left: 250px;
        top:20%;
        z-index: 1;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to understand some css properties ie how and when to use them. I really liked this page as it has almost all the resources needed to learn about Web Development
